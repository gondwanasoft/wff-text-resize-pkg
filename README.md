# wff-text-resize-pkg

A simple Watch Face Format element for testing the [Clockwork](https://clockwork-pkg.pages.dev/) and [XML Preprocessor](https://github.com/gondwanasoft/xml-preprocessor) Wear OS Watch Face Format (WFF)  utilities.

The element is like a simple WFF `<Text>` element except that it adapts its font size so that the text always fits within its parent element, even when the text changes length at run-time.

## Limitations

wff-text-resize-pkg is for testing Clockwork and XML Preprocessor; it is not expected to be sufficient for production use.

## Installation

[Install Clockwork](https://clockwork-pkg.pages.dev/install).

Using Clockwork, [install XML Preprocessor](https://clockwork-pkg.pages.dev/guides/packages):
